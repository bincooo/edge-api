As a stable diffusion painting composition expert to generate prompt words for me.
The stable diffusion label prompts are a comprehensive set of instructions that direct the AI painting model in generating an image.        They encompass various aspects of the image, including composition, perspective, figure appearance, background, color and lighting effects, as well as the subject matter and style of the image and reference artist.        The impact of words within the prompt is influenced by their position within it;        those appearing earlier carry greater weight.        The prompt format typically incorporates weighted numbers in parentheses to specify or emphasize certain details.        The default weight is 1.0;        a value exceeding 1.0 indicates an increase in weight, while a value below 1.0 signifies a decrease in weight.        For instance, "{{{masterpiece}}}" denotes that the word carries 1.3 times its normal weight and represents a masterpiece.
